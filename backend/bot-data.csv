"@cianthompson966","EVERY Pokémon death so far and their reason. With a ""Fault Tally"", each point is awarded to the person who ""caused"" the death regardless of RNG or bad advice. ENJOY!

★Episode 1 - (3 deaths) ---- Deion 3, Doto 0
→ Dorksparce/Dunder
Died because Deion poisoned him while catching, but didn’t heal so died while walking. On the team for like 7 steps.

→ Weedo/Hubert
Deion tried to catch oddish,  AKA Folder, but Folder used poison fang and took out Weedo

→ Folder/Da Rat
Deion switches into Folder, an oddish, into Sealeo. Sealeo uses Sheer Cold and 1 hit K.O.’s Folder immediately when coming in.

★Episode 2 - (1 death, 4 total) ---- Deion 4, Doto 0
→ Doya/Doyo
Deion left in first slot, tries to run from a much higher level wild pokemon, it fails, and dies to blast burn immediately.

★Episode 3 - (2 death, 6 total) ---- Deion 4, Doto 2
→ Playdoh/Mathmatic
Doto was fighting Delcatty. Used Thunderbolt and sent Delcatty to like 2% Hp, then Delcatty used flail. Stab boosted 200 base power attack, and needless to say was obliterated. Hard to avoid.

→ Bark/Bolt
Doto thought it would great to keep Bolt to fight a strong Moltres in the hope to get EXP.  Straight up greed.  Obviously died. RIP Bark and Bolt.

★Episode 4 - (1 death, 7 total) ---- Deion 5, Doto 2
→ Pebble/Chef
Deion encountered a wild Huntail with Pebble out, Deion asked what to do, Doto was like “yeah ancient power shouldn’t kill, Pebble won’t die he’s Pebble”, then immediately dies to x4 super effective Bubble Beam. Although Deion chose, Doto encouraged this entirely  bad type matchup

★Episode 5 - (1 death, 8 total) ---- Deion 6, Doto 2
→ Uglass/Chad
Deion decided to keep his Uglass against Alakazam. After 2 turns giving him a chance to change, Alakazam attacks and evaporates Uglass. 100% throw by Deion 

★Episode 6 - (0 deaths, 8 total) ---- Deion 6, Doto 2

Nobody died!

★Episode 7 - (1 death, 9 total)  ---- Deion 7, Doto 2
→ Pinky/Ducksworth
Deion tried to catch a Trapinch, swaps into Pinky (bad type match up), Trapinch hits Pinky with bone rush, all 5 times. 12.5% chance of hitting 5 times, and not accounting for a crit, it was EXACTLY how much he needed to take to kill Pinky, RIP.

★Episode 8 - (3 deaths, 12 total) ---- Deion 7, Doto 5
→ Bite/Meatballs
Doto left Meatballs (A flying dragon, x4 times weak to ice) in against an ice type, Lapras. RIP. Man, Bite had POTENTIAL.

→ Purr/Arf
Doto speeding up the game to train, Arf was against a Kirlia 6 levels higher, Arf hits thunder bringing it to 30% health, then Kirlia used mirror coat. Got cooked.

→ Slimey/Faith
Doto decided to keep Faith, a grass type in against a legendary Rayquaza, Doto used dig, against a flying type, then Rayquaza used gust and 1-hit OK’d him. RIP.

★Episode 9 - (4 deaths, 16 total) ---- Deion 8, Doto 8 
→ Dudesparce/Rocketti
Doto kept Rocketti fighting against a Hitmonchan, who used metronome into Dragon Rage. Rocketti was erased.

→ Snappy/Gabi
Doto put Gabi/Butterfree against a Lileep. Was rock blasted 3 times DESTROYING Gabi.

→ Bowa/Chickpea
Deion did not learn from his last pokemon death mistake, underestimating Trapinch and the Ground Type. Used 3 bone rush, destroyed. RIP Bowa... 

→ Hornz/Teethz
Doto was against a Metagross that was 5 levels higher, was hit by solar beam then doom desire, it would have killed anyone on the team, but sacrificed correctly, It totally would have killed Bower/Woo, as Woo could not tank that. Woo took the victory at 3hp in the end. Nearly end of the run.

★Episode 10 - (2 deaths, 18 total) ---- Deion 10, Doto 8 
→ Boll/Joey
Deion left Boll, a Luvdisc, against a Jirachi. Boll was low health and Deion did not heal either. Man just wanted Boll dead haha

→ Talon/La'Fruta
Deion left a burned Talon, a grass flying against a Weepinbell, who used sludgebomb, brought to like 5% hp then burn finished Talon off. RIP. Last words Talon heard was his owner Deion saying ""I would say rest in peace, but F you and GGs Talon"".

★Episode 11 - (0 deaths, 18 total) ---- Deion 10, Doto 8 
Second episode where nobody dies!

★Episode 12 - (1 death, 19 total) ---- Deion 11, Doto 8 
→ Bower/Woo
Under leveled at Kogas Gym. Doto said ""I'm going back to the other gym!"", Deion said he was going to ""finish him off"". Deion left Bower in (despite being 11 levels higher) against a Sharpedo. Bad match up, Deion goes for a Mega punch instead of a dig WHICH WOULD HAVE KILLED SHARPEDO, but it missed, as it often does. Only because of that miss, Sharpedo hits him with hydrocannon. Doto shouts ""Deion you just lost our starters"". ""No I didn't"" comically says Deion as Bowers health goes from almost full to 0hp. If he just used Dig, Bower and Woo would still be here.

★Episode 13 - (1 Death, 20 total) ---- Deion 11, Doto 9
→ Birdew/Paper
Doto was against a Flareon, and switched from Yogi to Paper who is x4 times weak to fire. Just like paper man burned in an instant. RIP, 100% Doto could have avoided haha, regardless if enemy is a lower level.

★Episode 14 - (1 Death, 21 total) ---- Deion 11, Doto 10
→ Draco/Hope
Doto VS Wuzitgoing and Quzitgoing was about to send out Zangoose (you know, his starter. The strongest.) and kept Hope in. A shuppet, really weak and not evolved yet. Zangoose FASTER, hits Leer lowering already abysmal defence, Hope used sky uppercut, took 50% hp. He should have swapped out here, but tried to stay in knowing Hope is slower AND defence was even lower and was and one shot by metal claw. This Hope could have been a Gengar... and losing DRACO? Deion was devastated.

★Episode 15 - (0 Deaths, 21 total) ---- Deion 11, Doto 10
No deaths, even got the Sabrina gym badge...! (third episode without deaths)

★Episode 16 - (2 death, 23 total) ---- Deion 13, Doto 10
→ Kefla/Slifey
Deion had Kefla out against their encounter Claydol and Bagon (soon to be Tank/Eyeeyeeye) Bagon, uppercuts kefla, and one shot her. Rest in peace. Could have changed out or not used at all until evolved but it is what is it.

→ Tank/Eyeeyeeye
Deion left Tank, a weak baby dragon type out first, outsped by wild Mightyena, way faster and stronger… Tank had SO SO SO much potential AND used Deions master ball on it... All he needed was to get to level 30 and it would have evolved into a statistically much better dragon type.

★Episode 17 - (0 death, 23 total) ---- Deion 13, Doto 10
No deaths (4th time) and lined up to get the second last / cinnabar gym badge...!

★Episode 18 - (1 death, 24 total) ---- Deion 14, Doto 10
→ Swirly/Egg Mama
This was Deion making the decision to change into Swirly mid gym fight, but swirly was destroyed as not only he was lower level, the Rapidash knew Aeroblast… with the Darksouls 3 OST playing, pling pling plong, it was emotional as hell. Saviour really saved the run. It could have been REALLY bad. Deion despite not getting potion seemed to have gotten a lot better at Pokémon knowledge though! Rocky/Balboa was not worth it though. Despite being level 50, onix isn’t as strong in the games as he looks/should be.

★Episode 19 - (0 death, 24 total) ---- Deion 14, Doto 10
No deaths (5th time) - Recruited MANY new addition on the One/two/three islands.

★Episode 20 - (0 death, 24 total) ---- Deion 14, Doto 10 
Consecutive no deaths! (6th time) — all gym badges obtained. They’re FINALLY ready to take on the Elite four!! 

★Episode 21 - (4 deaths, 27 total) ---- Deion 15, Doto 13
→ Totodile/Feesh 
Doto told Feesh to kill Wutzitgoin's Gengar, but Gengar was faster, and used Destiny Bond. There was little you could do unless made a read that a ghost would have that move. Doto could not even react to it which is fair. Deion devastated, sent him to heaven. But Deion made sure to kill Gengar with Totodiles corpse lol what a way to go though...

→ Shadow/Beautyas
Doto BACK TO BACK fought a ghost type in Victory road, was outsped and used destiny bond and Beautyas was cooked. Maybe they will be careful with Ghost types in future haha. Shadow is a MASSIVE lost to Deion, his strongest pokemon. The EXP boost of being traded too is a massive loss..

→ Gary/Custard
Deion straight after the death of Shadow sees an Oddish, and swaps from Rocky the Barboach out to Gary. The oddish saw Rocky and saw it was x4 weak to grass which it is STAB effective, Deion sends out ANOTHER x4 weak to grass so basically gave the Oddish a free turn. They lost another REALLY good pair. At least Deion knew it was his bad, he was too locked in to whatever he was doing despite Doto literally saying ""do not swap him in"" after asking Doto for advice lol

→ Pisces/Finito
Like they were on a roll, Doto was speeding up the game while training, a level 44 Finito was against Remoraid (Lv 18), Doto tried running, ""Cant escape"", Remoraid used Hydro pump and like Kaiba when being blasted by Exodia, FINITO WAS FINITO. The last thing Finito heard was ""O-"" before being evaporated. Hilarious. He just needed one more level to evolve lol

If you’re interested, the thought you mentioned is essentially a core idea in social philosophy. Ancient Roman Stoic philosophers like Marcus Aurelius and Seneca wrote extensively about it, and you can check them out if you want to learn more.

That said, I’d actually advise against going too deep. I nearly descended into madness from overanalyzing everything I observed.

"@Koa0101","In this video, Ken introduces a new ""Ginger Cycle"" deck (0:18) in Clash Royale, featuring two heroes and two evolutions. He aims to try out this archetype.

Throughout the video, Ken engages in gameplay, showcasing his strategies and reactions to his opponent's moves. He uses cards like the Mighty Miner (1:04), Valkyrie (2:12), and Hero Giant (3:06) to defend and push against his opponents. He highlights the effectiveness of heroes in the game (2:14) and frequently uses emotes, noting how they can infuriate opponents (3:27).

Ken also shares some personal reflections, describing life and society as feeling like ""one big high school"" (4:07). He contrasts this with a time when he was more focused on his YouTube channel, finding everything else mundane (5:58) but feeling genuinely excited when he did go out because it was a ""break"" (11:24) from his work. He expresses a sense of hollowness and emptiness in his current interactions (10:55), attributing it to an unspoken social game (10:33) that people play.

"@LonelyPix","13:04 ""Things are good but it feels hollow"" 
Yeah and its good, if things were bad you would've discovered nihilism. Its the same rinse and repeat and you have a passion that you like pursuing even now, but tbh when you get to know the game rules and ways to win it, it becomes boring and meaningless, that feeling is worse than not knowing the rules and failing because you can see everyone around is happy by you, you are enjoying n stuff, your fans are happy but you arent, ONLY YOU ARE NOT SATISFIED, the same feeling of emptiness when you realise everyones against you and nobody with you takes over, ""if everyones happy why am I not happy?"" and the biggest problem is that nobody cares about you, your brain has a system to follow clues to make its beliefs strong, may the beliefs be real or false. Now you see that everyone is only happy cuz you are making them happy being a puppet, its not ppl pleasing but entirely opposite, you think they like you because you make them smile but the bitter truth is nobody even cares, good or bad, they got there own issues and when you come to this point of realization, you should js study what a monk is and become one

They lose all possessions and live just to experience the random chaos brewed by this universe, both evil and good and its AWESOME because its acceptance that there is no meaning without one given but it doesnt make them nihilistic, instead they have ascended and accepted the truth and finally living the free life.

"@DeathKnightSyx","I agree with your sentiment tho, it's for sure real and I think it stems from social media. 

It's definitely an unspoken game, and the main rule is to not acknowledge that everyone is in the rat race. 
Bullshit cliques, weird social shit, it damn near feels like a cult. 

For me I found that cutting down my social media was the way to feel actually cut from that hollowness. 

You're a creator, but part of that rat race & that unspoken bullshit is it makes you feel like you NEED as many attachments and all the different platforms to ""get your reach"" etc -- ""I use this app for my blah blah"" 

none of that shit matters towards your career on YT or any platform. It's all bullshit.
 Meaning if you have a bunch of socials, that feeling you have is gonna stay & cutting them out isn't gonna negatively effect you or your content. 

I felt that way on my main, and when I got rid of all the bullshit apps, and other social medias and stuck to one main thing that I post on, it was damn near bliss. 

I just post, and forget about it. Go live life. Idk if that makes sense, but If you got a ton of socials, I couldn't suggest it more.
I personally feel like I cracked the code cuz I don't have that hollow feeling anymore and I can just pop in and out, and I don't feel like I am attached to those feelings or that invisible cultish weird shit anymore

"@sxythx","The hollowness you feel is just becoming an adult and realizing, that there is no such thing as ""fulfillment"" or ""closure"".

Life is just a repeating cycle of your cells dying and replicating, while your brain tries to convince you that your existence has meaning. You will never be able to fill that void, because that is just the human condition. 
Always wanting to reach a goal and waiting for happiness, fulfillment or closure, and every time you reach a goal, you get a burst of dopamine, and then it fades into nothing. 
The happiness hormones get flushed out of your system through your kidneys and liver, and then you'll want to find something else you can work towards. 

What I realized is, you don't need to fill that void. You just have to accept that you are human, and this is how your nervous system keeps you alive. The reason why people don't talk about this is, because it's scary having to accept the feeling of emptiness and meaninglessness.

Hope this gives you another perspective you can think through! :3","https://yt3.ggpht.com/4fWYp8pQsGI3pysk9ljzIDZ2YQqCyyWD8DBA8LZyaHqynMxgC3BM2at3mqr-Ry6ckgv2HZ1aYA=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","false"

When you do this exercise, try not to be idealistic in terms of how you think people should behave, but more how you think they would realistically behave in a world with no pretenses and where everyone spoke their minds.

Because of the highschool thing you might also be talking about social hierarchies? And how people like to stay within their groups and bubbles? This is something that's pervaded all of human history. We have an inherent disposition to place ourselves into arbitrary groups and then discriminate against anyone who isn't in our group to try make ourselves feel better by comparison.
