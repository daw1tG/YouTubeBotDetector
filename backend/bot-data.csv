"@cianthompson966","EVERY Pokémon death so far and their reason. With a ""Fault Tally"", each point is awarded to the person who ""caused"" the death regardless of RNG or bad advice. ENJOY!

★Episode 1 - (3 deaths) ---- Deion 3, Doto 0
→ Dorksparce/Dunder
Died because Deion poisoned him while catching, but didn’t heal so died while walking. On the team for like 7 steps.

→ Weedo/Hubert
Deion tried to catch oddish,  AKA Folder, but Folder used poison fang and took out Weedo

→ Folder/Da Rat
Deion switches into Folder, an oddish, into Sealeo. Sealeo uses Sheer Cold and 1 hit K.O.’s Folder immediately when coming in.

★Episode 2 - (1 death, 4 total) ---- Deion 4, Doto 0
→ Doya/Doyo
Deion left in first slot, tries to run from a much higher level wild pokemon, it fails, and dies to blast burn immediately.

★Episode 3 - (2 death, 6 total) ---- Deion 4, Doto 2
→ Playdoh/Mathmatic
Doto was fighting Delcatty. Used Thunderbolt and sent Delcatty to like 2% Hp, then Delcatty used flail. Stab boosted 200 base power attack, and needless to say was obliterated. Hard to avoid.

→ Bark/Bolt
Doto thought it would great to keep Bolt to fight a strong Moltres in the hope to get EXP.  Straight up greed.  Obviously died. RIP Bark and Bolt.

★Episode 4 - (1 death, 7 total) ---- Deion 5, Doto 2
→ Pebble/Chef
Deion encountered a wild Huntail with Pebble out, Deion asked what to do, Doto was like “yeah ancient power shouldn’t kill, Pebble won’t die he’s Pebble”, then immediately dies to x4 super effective Bubble Beam. Although Deion chose, Doto encouraged this entirely  bad type matchup

★Episode 5 - (1 death, 8 total) ---- Deion 6, Doto 2
→ Uglass/Chad
Deion decided to keep his Uglass against Alakazam. After 2 turns giving him a chance to change, Alakazam attacks and evaporates Uglass. 100% throw by Deion 

★Episode 6 - (0 deaths, 8 total) ---- Deion 6, Doto 2

Nobody died!

★Episode 7 - (1 death, 9 total)  ---- Deion 7, Doto 2
→ Pinky/Ducksworth
Deion tried to catch a Trapinch, swaps into Pinky (bad type match up), Trapinch hits Pinky with bone rush, all 5 times. 12.5% chance of hitting 5 times, and not accounting for a crit, it was EXACTLY how much he needed to take to kill Pinky, RIP.

★Episode 8 - (3 deaths, 12 total) ---- Deion 7, Doto 5
→ Bite/Meatballs
Doto left Meatballs (A flying dragon, x4 times weak to ice) in against an ice type, Lapras. RIP. Man, Bite had POTENTIAL.

→ Purr/Arf
Doto speeding up the game to train, Arf was against a Kirlia 6 levels higher, Arf hits thunder bringing it to 30% health, then Kirlia used mirror coat. Got cooked.

→ Slimey/Faith
Doto decided to keep Faith, a grass type in against a legendary Rayquaza, Doto used dig, against a flying type, then Rayquaza used gust and 1-hit OK’d him. RIP.

★Episode 9 - (4 deaths, 16 total) ---- Deion 8, Doto 8 
→ Dudesparce/Rocketti
Doto kept Rocketti fighting against a Hitmonchan, who used metronome into Dragon Rage. Rocketti was erased.

→ Snappy/Gabi
Doto put Gabi/Butterfree against a Lileep. Was rock blasted 3 times DESTROYING Gabi.

→ Bowa/Chickpea
Deion did not learn from his last pokemon death mistake, underestimating Trapinch and the Ground Type. Used 3 bone rush, destroyed. RIP Bowa... 

→ Hornz/Teethz
Doto was against a Metagross that was 5 levels higher, was hit by solar beam then doom desire, it would have killed anyone on the team, but sacrificed correctly, It totally would have killed Bower/Woo, as Woo could not tank that. Woo took the victory at 3hp in the end. Nearly end of the run.

★Episode 10 - (2 deaths, 18 total) ---- Deion 10, Doto 8 
→ Boll/Joey
Deion left Boll, a Luvdisc, against a Jirachi. Boll was low health and Deion did not heal either. Man just wanted Boll dead haha

→ Talon/La'Fruta
Deion left a burned Talon, a grass flying against a Weepinbell, who used sludgebomb, brought to like 5% hp then burn finished Talon off. RIP. Last words Talon heard was his owner Deion saying ""I would say rest in peace, but F you and GGs Talon"".

★Episode 11 - (0 deaths, 18 total) ---- Deion 10, Doto 8 
Second episode where nobody dies!

★Episode 12 - (1 death, 19 total) ---- Deion 11, Doto 8 
→ Bower/Woo
Under leveled at Kogas Gym. Doto said ""I'm going back to the other gym!"", Deion said he was going to ""finish him off"". Deion left Bower in (despite being 11 levels higher) against a Sharpedo. Bad match up, Deion goes for a Mega punch instead of a dig WHICH WOULD HAVE KILLED SHARPEDO, but it missed, as it often does. Only because of that miss, Sharpedo hits him with hydrocannon. Doto shouts ""Deion you just lost our starters"". ""No I didn't"" comically says Deion as Bowers health goes from almost full to 0hp. If he just used Dig, Bower and Woo would still be here.

★Episode 13 - (1 Death, 20 total) ---- Deion 11, Doto 9
→ Birdew/Paper
Doto was against a Flareon, and switched from Yogi to Paper who is x4 times weak to fire. Just like paper man burned in an instant. RIP, 100% Doto could have avoided haha, regardless if enemy is a lower level.

★Episode 14 - (1 Death, 21 total) ---- Deion 11, Doto 10
→ Draco/Hope
Doto VS Wuzitgoing and Quzitgoing was about to send out Zangoose (you know, his starter. The strongest.) and kept Hope in. A shuppet, really weak and not evolved yet. Zangoose FASTER, hits Leer lowering already abysmal defence, Hope used sky uppercut, took 50% hp. He should have swapped out here, but tried to stay in knowing Hope is slower AND defence was even lower and was and one shot by metal claw. This Hope could have been a Gengar... and losing DRACO? Deion was devastated.

★Episode 15 - (0 Deaths, 21 total) ---- Deion 11, Doto 10
No deaths, even got the Sabrina gym badge...! (third episode without deaths)

★Episode 16 - (2 death, 23 total) ---- Deion 13, Doto 10
→ Kefla/Slifey
Deion had Kefla out against their encounter Claydol and Bagon (soon to be Tank/Eyeeyeeye) Bagon, uppercuts kefla, and one shot her. Rest in peace. Could have changed out or not used at all until evolved but it is what is it.

→ Tank/Eyeeyeeye
Deion left Tank, a weak baby dragon type out first, outsped by wild Mightyena, way faster and stronger… Tank had SO SO SO much potential AND used Deions master ball on it... All he needed was to get to level 30 and it would have evolved into a statistically much better dragon type.

★Episode 17 - (0 death, 23 total) ---- Deion 13, Doto 10
No deaths (4th time) and lined up to get the second last / cinnabar gym badge...!

★Episode 18 - (1 death, 24 total) ---- Deion 14, Doto 10
→ Swirly/Egg Mama
This was Deion making the decision to change into Swirly mid gym fight, but swirly was destroyed as not only he was lower level, the Rapidash knew Aeroblast… with the Darksouls 3 OST playing, pling pling plong, it was emotional as hell. Saviour really saved the run. It could have been REALLY bad. Deion despite not getting potion seemed to have gotten a lot better at Pokémon knowledge though! Rocky/Balboa was not worth it though. Despite being level 50, onix isn’t as strong in the games as he looks/should be.

★Episode 19 - (0 death, 24 total) ---- Deion 14, Doto 10
No deaths (5th time) - Recruited MANY new addition on the One/two/three islands.

★Episode 20 - (0 death, 24 total) ---- Deion 14, Doto 10 
Consecutive no deaths! (6th time) — all gym badges obtained. They’re FINALLY ready to take on the Elite four!! 

★Episode 21 - (4 deaths, 27 total) ---- Deion 15, Doto 13
→ Totodile/Feesh 
Doto told Feesh to kill Wutzitgoin's Gengar, but Gengar was faster, and used Destiny Bond. There was little you could do unless made a read that a ghost would have that move. Doto could not even react to it which is fair. Deion devastated, sent him to heaven. But Deion made sure to kill Gengar with Totodiles corpse lol what a way to go though...

→ Shadow/Beautyas
Doto BACK TO BACK fought a ghost type in Victory road, was outsped and used destiny bond and Beautyas was cooked. Maybe they will be careful with Ghost types in future haha. Shadow is a MASSIVE lost to Deion, his strongest pokemon. The EXP boost of being traded too is a massive loss..

→ Gary/Custard
Deion straight after the death of Shadow sees an Oddish, and swaps from Rocky the Barboach out to Gary. The oddish saw Rocky and saw it was x4 weak to grass which it is STAB effective, Deion sends out ANOTHER x4 weak to grass so basically gave the Oddish a free turn. They lost another REALLY good pair. At least Deion knew it was his bad, he was too locked in to whatever he was doing despite Doto literally saying ""do not swap him in"" after asking Doto for advice lol

→ Pisces/Finito
Like they were on a roll, Doto was speeding up the game while training, a level 44 Finito was against Remoraid (Lv 18), Doto tried running, ""Cant escape"", Remoraid used Hydro pump and like Kaiba when being blasted by Exodia, FINITO WAS FINITO. The last thing Finito heard was ""O-"" before being evaporated. Hilarious. He just needed one more level to evolve lol
